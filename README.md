# Space Game
## A GBA Masterpiece

### Story
Aliens are invading, and it is your job to stop them before they can reach and destroy earth. 

### Game
Move the character with the D-Pad, and fire lasers with A. Get a score of 10 to win. Beware--if your health decreases too much, you lose and the aliens win!

### Development
Space Game is written in C/C++ for the Game Boy Advance -- you can run it on a cartridge!

The game makes smart use of the GBA's Bitmap video mode and the DMA in order to create an efficient and speedy space shooter with:
- A parallax star background with 2 layers
- An array of enemies to defeat
- A ship and the ability to fire lasers that move across the screen
- Animations like
    - Ship death
    - Turning
    - Hit Flashes
- And a dynamic HUD
